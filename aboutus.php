      <h1>About RMSTU Online Hospital</h1>
      <p align="justify">The government of Bangladesh established RMSTU Online Hospital Management System in 2020 at Rangamati.[3] Instruction began in December 2019,[4][5] with 53 students, but operations were soon suspended until the end of January.[1] The groups believe that students, staff, and faculty would come predominantly from outside the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and their settlement in Rangamati would change the character of the region.</p>
      <p align="justify"> The Hospital located in Rangamati Science and Technology University, Bhoyalla of Rangamati Hill District.</p>
      <p align="justify">Medicinal plants are an important part of natural wealth. They serve as important therapeutic agents as well as valuable raw materials for manufacturing numerous traditional and modern medicines. The history of medicinal plant use for overcoming diseases and related sufferings is probably as old as humans. Our ancestors were forced to use any natural substances that they could find to ease their sufferings caused by acute and chronic illness, physical discomforts, wounds and injuries, and even terminal illness. Since that ancient time, plants with therapeutic properties have occupied an important place in the disease treatment practices.


The principal aim of this project is two-fold: (i) to provide detailed information on locally important medicinal plants of RMSTU, Rangamati and (ii) to preserve the traditional knowledge of herbal healers on medicinal plants use. This project describes 31 important species with medicinal propertries, and including the scientific name; Bengali name; family name; vernacular name; general description; distribution; physiographic, edaphic and biotic requirements; silviculture charecteristics; phenological charecteristics; regenaration; chemical contituents; medicinal uses; other uses; photographs and traditional use by the herbal healers of Rangamati.

This project is one of the pioneering encyclopedic compilations in Bangladesh that can provide the reader with all the above silvicultural information of different medicinal plants at a glance.
